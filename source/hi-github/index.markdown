I thought you might want to know a little bit more about me than what's on my application, and wanted to  showcase a few of the things I've been working on. So I put together this little page that sums up a few things about me.

### Who are you?

I'm Kyle Macey. I grew up in rural upstate New York. I've been a sous chef, a world karate champion, and a farm hand. I've been a web developer professionally for 5 years, and have been freelancing for 8. I'm married with no children (yet?) and have two cats.

I like using Ruby for most of my projects, but am also familiar with a variety of other languages and platforms. I have done work with Javascript, Cordova, Coldfusion, PHP, Python, and have even dabbled in Android development.  

### Why do you want to work at GitHub?

GitHub really shares a lot of the values that I hold. I believe in fostering good software development practices, to always be growing, and to have fun doing what I love to do most. GitHub would face me with new and exciting challenges to always keep me learning, and hold me to a standard that would make me proud as a developer to adhere to. Also, on a more shallow note, HQ 3.0 looks pretty sexy.

### I see here on your resum√© that you're currently a manager, are you looking for a management position?

Not necessarily, though I wouldn't be opposed to it. I've found management to introduce a lot of distractions that allow me to focus on my passions. I've recently decided that I want to be the best developer I can be, and I'm going to base my future career decisions based on that goal.

### What would you see yourself doing at GitHub?

Well, I've [heard tell](http://www.confreaks.com/videos/3764-railsberry2013-internal-tools-make-or-break-your-team) of an Internal Tools Team at GitHub which sounds really exciting to me. I've always liked building things that I use myself, and I like having instant, honest feedback from my peers who are also users. Plus, I feel a little less conservative about what I can throw out there with internal apps. This allows me to try out new things and really break forward with new ideas.

### What are you working on now?

I'm trying to get rolling on my new pet project, [iodi](https://github.com/KyleMacey/iodi). It's essentially going to be an app that talks to multiple API's to get a story about what you've done each day. The CEO where I work likes getting an email every day telling him what I've done. I don't like doing this, thinking to myself *if he just learned all the tools I use, he would **know** what I'd done today.* I realized that was probably a tall order: asking a non-technical person to learn Pivotal Tracker, GitHub, Jenkins, etc.  So I've started working on this app which will have sort of an if-this-then-that feel to it, where users connect to different channels. Every day, the app will craft a readable, newspaper-style report with the data from the channels and send it to a configured email. I really hope it helps close that software-to-business gap that small to medium sized businesses seem to suffer from.

### Do you have other projects we can look at?

Sure!

[TestEase:](https://github.com/KyleMacey/test_ease) A simple ruby gem that disables MD5 hashing for passwords in ActiveModel when running tests.

[spree_google_shopping:](https://github.com/salzmanGroup/spree-google-shopping) A (Spree Commerce)[https://github.com/spree/spree] extension that supports exporting products from Spree into Google's Content for Shopping API. This started as a project for my job, so it's a bit concise at the moment. I plan to open it up soon and support more versions of Spree.

[Staas.io (Stack-as-a-Service):](http://staas.io) My project from Startup Weekend this past year. A marketplace for software stacks. Was intended to support one-click deployments using chef and consolidated account management for external services (hosting, version control, SaaS, etc.)
