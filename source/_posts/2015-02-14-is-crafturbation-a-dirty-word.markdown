Recently, I was having a conversation at the bar with [Chris](https://twitter.com/chorn) about trends in software development. I had pointed out that there is a  strong push toward perfectionism not only in code, but in the process of actually developing a product. It seemed to me that developers care just as much now about their working environment, project management, and employment philosophies as they do the score they receive on Code Climate.

Chris noted that those who get so involved with this sort of perfectionism have a tendency to fall out of business alignment, and promptly coined a term for the phenomena: "crafturbation". It essentially describes when a developer or team of developers spends a large amount of their energy enforcin

Our conversation really got me thinking about the entire situation. Is there a point where we focus so much on our methodologies that we lose sight of business goals?
