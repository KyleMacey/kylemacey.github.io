I often get asked about what I do by the people I know. It's hard to describe my average workday without using words like "awesome", "gnarley", or "fun". Frankly, I love what I do, and I love working with the people I do. Now, I know that programming isn't necessarily for everyone, but I believe that many people write it off that would not only find programming enjoyable, but might also be pretty awesome.

So what do I do? I'm a Ruby developer! I make awesome websites and applications to make people's lives better! What's Ruby, you ask?

In short, Ruby is a programming language that's flexible, relatable to real-world analogies, and, most of all, fun to learn!

After having tried to persuade many before, I've decided to compile all my best reasoning for learning to code into a nice, easy to read list. If you're not a developer already, look through it and consider learning. If you are a coder, then maybe there will be some points here to grow your local Ruby community. Or maybe you haven't learned Ruby yet, and are looking for reasons to learn a new language.
